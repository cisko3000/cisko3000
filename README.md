# About

I've been coding and developing apps for a long time. I'm passionate about designing extendeble and composable code; it took me a while to even start thinking about that. When I started coding, I just wanted to get something working and out the window. Many things were different back then, with regard to both myself and the opportunities available.

I am currently working at Grok (grokstream.com). Grok's product changes how companies leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver service assurance. Honestly, I don't have much time to contribute to opensource software; I find the work I do at Grok very fullfilling. I get to work on interesting problems alongside a diverse team of experts; data scientists, architects, devops, and front-end developers.

I'm grateful that I can choose who I work with, but that doesn't mean I haven't come across problematic people out in the wild; developers that want to have an argument over renaming "master" to "main"; a CTO that rejects my application because I wear a hat in my profile picture; the list goes on but I digress. I like to stay focused with the eyes on the prize. Proficiency and mastery have improved my quality of life.
